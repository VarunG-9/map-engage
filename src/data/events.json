It is also a center forexperimentation and education, home to specialized repair facilities and workshopson sustainable design and the potential of waste.\nNew ideas, ranging from 3D printed plastic building bricks to leather made from fruit peels, are piloted at The Barn, and thenscaled up in many other parts of the city. The Barn has also led to a completely different social dynamic than existed in the 2010s, when the main options for spending time with friends included drinking at a caf\u00e9 or bar. People from all corners of the city come to the Barn to learn new skills, but also to socialize while repairing their own clothes or trading their old furniture for something new.\nCheck out this video on what they do here:\u00a0Innovation Barn Video\nRequired LCE Waiver:\u00a0FILL OUT WAIVER HERE\n-Transportation is provided\nIf you have any questions on this event, feel free to reach out to the Student Director of the Environment and Animals Committee, Zack Lowell via email: zlowell@charlotte.edu",

During the fall semester, students work with the sub-system team of their choosing and begin designing the club rocket. Students will learn how to use Open Rocket to evaluate their designs and then move forward to choosing supplies. During the Spring semester, students then begin the assembly of each individual sub-system until the club as a whole is ready for the final assembly on launch day at the end of the semester. Students will then have the opportunity to travel to Dalzell South Carolina to launch the club rocket in April 2025.",

You are welcome to meet us there, but make sure someone knows that and has your contact for a smooth and easy meetup! Similarly, reach out if you are looking to carpool! No school van so we need to have our numbers right before we meet up and get ready to go.\nPack snacks and water! Sunglasses, hats/head coverings typically good to bring along. Wear layers for a range of temperature, and a windbreak or jacket as necessary per conditions. Possible stops for quick breakfast on the go and/or lunch afterwards depending on cars and schedules.\nDon't forget to stay hydrated and get warmed up with some stretches.
