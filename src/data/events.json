    "description": "Struggling with procrastination? One part of you knows what you should be doing, and another part of you still puts it off until the last minute or doesn't do it at all, so you're left feeling panicked, guilty, or frustrated with yourself. Join us for a workshop addressing common causes of procrastination, including perfectionism and external pressures. We will explore the thoughts, behaviors, and emotions that often prevent us from being as productive and on-task as we would like. We will discuss practical tools to improve time management and accountability, along with ways to reframe your mindset and manage the emotions that come up with procrastination.\n\u00a0\nThis is a 3 part workshop happening on 3 consecutive Wednesdays.

Nonverbal communications are the most challenging aspect for people to improve when public speaking. In this workshop, we will discuss the most important nonverbal tips for public speaking.\nThis information will significantly assist you in communication because nonverbal communication and verbal communication are the two core components of public speaking. While verbal communication can be improved with extensive practice, nonverbal communication directly impacts the audience\u2019s ability to comprehend the message. Imagine, if you see a public speaker who delivers their point coherently and comprehensively, what will you think if they keep looking down or sideways, and put their hands behind their back? Between verbal and non-verbal communication, it\u2019s the latter who speaks louder. Think about it. By paying close attention to your nonverbal communication, you can improve the delivery of your message.\n\u00a0\nRegister Here\n\u00a0\nPresenter: Dr. Daryl L.

Are you familiar with the saying, \"it's not what you know, it's who you know\"? In the US, connections with people carry a lot of weight when looking for a job. This is why networking is a fundamental skill for launching and furthering your career. However, when we hear the word \"networking,\" we often think of \"doing lunch,\" selling ourselves, and handing out business cards. If we changed the word to \u201cconnecting,\u201d we might feel better about it. Your job search begins with the people you know! Never underestimate their knowledge and influence.
